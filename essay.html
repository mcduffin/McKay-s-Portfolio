      <h2>Reflective Essay</h2>
      
      <p lang="en">During my time as a graduate student studying technical communication at Texas Tech, I have had the opportunity to strengthen my skills as a communicator, learn essential theoretical foundations surrounding technical communication, and apply what I learned by completing several different artifacts. The artifacts are projects that represent different workplace documents. My goal is to join the industry as a technical writer and communicator. I am interested in either pursuing writing documentation or risk communication.</p>
      <p lang="en">The program has helped me to connect the importance of the rhetorical situation to the act of technical communication. The audience and their needs must be understood to create effective messages. Informational accuracy alone is not enough for a message to be effective. Technical communicators bridge gaps between subject matter experts &#40;SMEs&#41; and their audiences by transforming information into a message that the audience receives. Understanding various factors that influence how a message is received defines the rhetorical situation. Bitzer &#40;1992&#41; offers insight into the rhetorical situation by stating the rhetorical situation creates the need or exigence for a message in the first place. The author&#8217;s insight is meaningful because if the audience and their needs are a part of the rhetorical situation then the main role for a technical communicator is to help meet the needs of the audience.</p>
      <p lang="en">I have also learned the importance of the roles that technical communicators serve in the workplace. The technical communicator&#8217;s role is diverse because they are required to collaborate with many other people from different hierarchical groups, while also being required to work on their own at other times. Technical communicators must switch between a variety of contexts and situations seamlessly. They need to take ownership for the messages they create to be an effective communicator. Slack, Miller, and Doak &#40;1993&#41; introduce the concept of, &#8220;technical communicator as author,&#8221; where they establish that technical communicators articulate meaning through the messages they create. The act of communication reveals a transfer of power, and that power is only used responsibly when the people who create the messages are seen as authors of their own writing who can claim ownership of what they write. The concept of authorship is important because technical writers have been rendered invisible in the past. When people are allowed to own what they create they must also take responsibility with what they say to create a more ethical workspace.</p>
      <p lang="en">But due to the rise of social media and increased globalization, the field of technical communication is expanding and changing. One area of social media that is influencing technical communication practices is online help forums. Frith argues that online help forums should be considered technical communication and that technical communicators are needed to manage expanding digital sites that users will consult before looking at more official documentation. The author states that, &#8220;21st century technical communicators should think through how to incorporate social media content in their documentation strategies&#8221; &#40;Frith, 2014&#41;. The author highlights how more nontraditional online spaces are being utilized by users and companies alike for technical information. When technical communicators engage in tactical technical communication, which emphasizes targeted communication on an individual level, they will be able to pivot with the field&#8217;s changing landscape and engage with users in new and profound ways.</p>
      <h3>Program Outcomes</h3>
      <p lang="en">The reflective essay demonstrates how my artifacts enabled me to meet the following program outcomes&#58;</p>
      <p lang="en">
        <ol>
          <li>Students will be able to analyze and respond appropriately to rhetorical situations and key issues in the field, including the differing goals and agendas of audiences, organizations, and societies.</li>
          <li>Students will be able to use a variety of appropriate communication technologies and media.</li>
          <li>Students will be able to create effective and user&#8211;centered technical documentation justified with relevant theory.</li>
          <li>Students will be able to demonstrate sensitivity to the ethical, professional, and cultural issues that face technical communicators.</li>
          <li>Students will be able to demonstrate the capacity to enter the workforce in technical communication as advanced hires, OR to enter doctoral programs in rhetoric, technical communication, and related fields.</li>
          <li>Students will be able to demonstrate a sense of professionalism and a commitment to the profession.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Artifact Descriptions</h3>
      <p lang="en">A brief summary of each artifact or project is provided below, in addition to the contexts and revisions surrounding each project. In the portfolio, the six artifacts were organized into two groups according to themes. The first group of artifacts represents the theme of &#8220;Risk Communication.&#8221; The second group of artifacts represents the theme of &#8220;Professional Documentation.&#8221;</p>
      <h4>Risk Communication</h4>
      <p lang="en">The following three artifacts are grouped together under the theme of, &#8220;Risk Communication&#8221; because each project addresses different aspects or consequences of risk communication itself. Artifact 1 produces recommendations about how to effectively manage a particular health risk. Artifact 2 engages in risk communication directly by educating a target population about the risk of distracted driving. Artifact 3 explores the consequences of risk communication by uncovering if the risk communication the government provides internally is seen as more important than risk communication with the public. The artifacts will enable me to work as a risk communicator because these projects demonstrate that I know how to study and communicate different risks for different audiences.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Technical Report</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 1, the Technical Report, is an example of an investigative report that I wrote for Dr. Baake&#8217;s English 5372 Technical Reports class. The goal of the report what to gather information on a subject, compare different approaches, and make targeted recommendations to bring about the desired change or goal. I chose to investigate the best treatment for a heart condition called atrial fibrillation. Since the condition can have many different root causes, I needed to narrow the scope of my search. I decided to center the report around my experience with atrial fibrillation and investigate what would be the best treatment for me moving forward.</p>
      <p lang="en">The main reason I decided to write the report is because I developed the condition at the age of eighteen. Dozens of specialists were unable to point to a cause as to why this happened in the first place. The rarity of developing the disorder at such a young age also dramatically altered my treatment plan when compared to other people who have the same heart condition. The report allowed me to generate answers for my own future while also allowing me to demonstrate that I can write an effective report. The assignment connects to the theme of risk communication because the report advised the best treatment for managing the health risks that atrial fibrillation creates.</p>
      <p lang="en">If I were to revise and retool this report for the workplace, I would have to broaden the scope of the report. I would have to make it less personal, and focus the report on general treatments for afib in general. Due to privacy concerns or policies dictating workplace resources, an extensive report would not be created to serve only one person. In addition, I would have to expand the recommendations to include other forms of treatment outside of just drug&#8211;based interventions for long&#8211;term treatment plans.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Risk Message</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 2 is called the Risk Message. The assignment is an example of a risk message I wrote to communicate the dangers of texting while driving to high school students. The assignment allowed me to play the role of a risk communicator. Although the exercise itself was hypothetical, the assignment was invaluable in allowing me to identify a problem, research an audience, and then use best communication practices for that audience. The artifact is a student worksheet that uses a method called a discreet choice experiment, which is a written simulation that presents the user with choices. Each choice that is selected reveals the audience&#8217;s perception about the risk itself. The second page contained a fact sheet about texting while driving while also including a few discussion questions for students to consider. A brief reflection on the effectiveness of the message followed. The artifact relates to the theme of risk communication because it is an example of risk communication in action.</p>
      <p lang="en">Since I explored the role of a risk communicator when making the artifact, there are a few different ways I could improve the artifact if the risk message was used in a classroom setting. First, I would increase the number of questions for the discrete choice experiment. Using three or four questions created a simulation that was too short. I would place the references in a larger font and use double&#8211;sided paper to keep the assignment intact while allowing for more information to be added. If I worked as a risk communicator, I might also create a couple different versions of the worksheet to explore different scenarios that involve texting and driving.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Research Paper</em></p>
      <p lang="en">The Research Paper, or Artifact 3, allowed me to analyze if the risk communication that the SEC used concerning fraud was different with internal government communication or external communication with the public. I used critical discourse analysis to analyze a group of documents. The first set of documents were government memos that detailed the security flaws and risks of a tip processing system for the SEC. The second group of documents contained bulletins created by the SEC that warned the public about the risks of investor fraud. My discourse analysis revealed that the communication methods that the government uses internally is different and more privileged than the external risk communication with the public. The research is currently unpublished. The artifact relates to the theme of risk communication because the paper uncovers how governmental risk communication differs across discourses and contexts.</p>
      <p lang="en">My research uncovered a power disparity in the risk communication between the government and the public because internal government discourses about risk were privileged above other discourses. I used the method of critical discourse analysis to come to this conclusion. I revised the paper by clarifying how I chose the terms for discourse analysis to build a sense of trust between myself and my audience. I used principles I learned from Dr. Grace&#8217;s English 5377 Risk Communication class to understand how trust between the messenger and the audience is crucial for effective risk communication. But what can be done about correcting the disparities that exist in risk communication&#63; One solution is to change the communication practices themselves to meet the needs and goals of different audiences.</p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 3 is an academic paper. Although the research is unpublished, an academic paper would not easily translate to a workplace document. But the writing strategies I used to produce the paper can be used to effectively communicate in the workplace. The artifact demonstrates my ability to investigate an issue independently, use real world sources to prove an idea, and form meaningful conclusions that can be used by others. The paper also allowed me to learn about the principle of audience awareness, since any piece of writing that investigates an issue or problem must be tailored to the needs of specific audiences. Artifact 3 is tailored for an academic audience based on these principles.</p>
      <h4>Professional Documentation</h4>
      <p lang="en">The following three artifacts are grouped together under the theme of, &#8220;Professional Documentation&#8221; because each artifact is an example of a key genre, or document type that exists in the workplace today. Artifact 4 is similar to memos, policies, or documents that determine ethical stances for particular workplace environments. Artifact 5 is an example of a grant, a key document that helps to secure funding for many businesses and nonprofits. Artifact 6 is an example of a usability report, an important type of document that tracks usability issues for an organization&#8217;s websites or other customer&#8211;facing products. The following artifacts will help me work in documentation because the projects demonstrate how I can write a wide variety of genres and adapt to many contexts in order to meet communication needs in the workplace.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Editing Values Statement</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 4 is called the Editing Values Statement. The assignment is a statement that offers my thoughts about publishing spaces, open access, and digital communication practices within an editing context. The artifact is an example of professional documentation because the document defines workplace values. Similarly, other workplace documents like Human Resource memos or handbooks communicate specific ethical values about a particular topic such as diversity in the workplace or conflict resolution management. Some workplace documents can communicate the ethical stance of an entire organization while other documents communicate the ethical values of a single person. Communicating my values about editing demonstrates my commitment to excellent editing practices that can create an equitable work environment.</p>
      <p lang="en">I revised the artifact according to Dr. Faris&#8217;s feedback from the English 5377 Editing in Digital Environments class. I clarified my language use, changed a few minor aspects of my belief statements to prevent reader confusion, and eliminated global statements that created unintended meanings. I also reframed my second belief stance to be more positive and reflect a focus on open access. I briefly wrote about how my own beliefs impact my personal practices as an editor.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Small Grant</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 5, known as the Small Grant, contains the major components of a grant which include&#58; an RFP, a Letter of Intent, and the grant proposal itself. In addition, a memo is included where I reflect on my experience of writing the grant. Artifact 5 is a research grant that proposes a research project to determine the best teaching methods to educate the public about fraudulent behaviors within their own companies. The grant was written in partnership with Utah State University and the Shingo Institute. The grant was written with the ACFE Research Institute as the funding organization. My research partner for the proposed project was Dr. Albrecht, a mentor from Utah State. Unfortunately, the grant was not submitted since Dr. Albrecht was not able to conduct field research at the time the grant was written. The artifact is an example of professional documentation because grants are a common workplace genre used to obtain funding for nonprofit organizations, charitable organizations, and academic institutions.</p>
      <p lang="en">If I were to revise Artifact 5 for the workplace, I would check with the university about the process for contacting the other university partners named in the grant. In addition, although the grant met the page requirement, I would have to review the budget further to make sure the monetary amounts listed met all requirements of different parties besides the funding organization. I did apply broad standards for determining the budget information. When implementing the grant project, I would also have to factor any limitations imposed by COVID in terms of travel expenses. I would then compare the grant to other successful grants that have won the funding organization&#8217;s approval.</p>
      <p lang="en"><em>Usability Report</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 6 is called the Usability Report. I wrote this assignment from the perspective of an independent usability consultant who was contracted to conduct a usability study for the website of a medical organization. I conducted the usability test for Kaiser Permanente and wrote a formal usability report with my recommendations for fixing the site. The report also included extensive research on the different audiences that used the site. The main theoretical framework for my recommendations was Functional Attitude Theory. Although the persona I adopted for the paper was fictional, I produced real recommendations for a real website. The artifact is an example of professional documentation because I practiced writing an important type of recommendation, a usability report, and produced the type of recommendations that are used within a professional workplace environment.</p>
      <p lang="en">I revised the assignment based on a peer review conducted at the end of Dr. Roach&#8217;s 5377 Websites and Rhetorical Theory class. I made impactful changes to the assignment, which included adding additional sources to the literature review, deleting a repetitive subsection, reorganizing some subheadings to enhance clarity, and reworded some recommendations to be further grounded in theory. Artifact 6 is the project that imitates a workplace document the most. The assignment serves as a usability report as if I were an independent consultant. If I were to revise the artifact for use in the workplace, I would reduce the sections about Functional Attitude theory. A client may want to know a general theoretical reason for my suggestions, but will not be interested in a literature review. I would have also included screen shots and user journeys to give more accurate descriptions of what parts of the company website failed to work.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 1</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to analyze and respond appropriately to rhetorical situations and key issues in the field, including the differing goals and agendas of audiences, organizations, and societies.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 3 and Artifact 4 best meet this outcome. Artifact 3, the Research Paper, meets the outcome because the research addresses a knowledge gap within the field of risk communication and responds to key issues by analyzing how different communication methods are used across differing audiences. The main actor analyzed in the paper is the SEC. The goals and agendas of the SEC&#8217;s departments differed greatly from the goals and agendas of the public, and their need for simple and clear risk communication.</p>
      <p lang="en">When writing the research paper, I was able to see how risk communication strategies affect society because of how risk communication is taking place in digital spaces where risk messages can reach far wider audiences than physical messages. When the government engages in risk communication the scope and impact on society widens. Understanding how risk communication is used in different spaces points back to the nature of risk communication itself. Balog&#8211;Way et al., &#40;2020&#41; mention how the field of risk communication is interdisciplinary, and that there is no single right answer or approach to effective risk communication. Frost &#40;2013&#41; discovered that community members engaged in risk communication through digital spaces in response to the ineffectiveness of the government&#8217;s risk communication in primarily physical spaces. Different audiences and organizations engage in different risk communication strategies in an attempt to meet their needs.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 2</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to use a variety of appropriate communication technologies and media.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 6 and Artifact 2 meet the objective of allowing students to use appropriate communication media. Artifact 6, the Usability Report, best meets the objective because I had to interact with key pieces of media to produce the report. The Usability Report makes recommendations about how to improve the user interface and user experience of a company website. The organization I chose was Kaiser Permanente.</p>
      <p lang="en">My interactions with the website went beyond simply citing information. I had to interact with the website pages, think like the user, and search for errors or inconsistencies in the digital interface to create my recommendations. I engaged with the company website, a piece of digital media, to understand what rhetorical strategies were being used, and which strategies worked the best. I also interacted with other digital reports and website resources when researching the various audiences that used the website. I revised the assignment by adding additional research, cutting out repetitive sections, and reorganizing subheadings to bring clarity to my recommendations.</p>
      <p lang="en">But my opportunity to use a variety of communication technologies came from the creation of my portfolio website. I hand coded the portfolio from scratch. The code editor that I used is called Visual Studio Code. The languages that I used include HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript. I also used the jQuery Library. Through my use of these communication technologies, I was able to identify key features to increase usability. I used the code to create responsive web design by making the portfolio mobile accessible. I ensured the styling of the website aligned with accessibility standards and provided a sound information architecture that allowed me to work on specific sections of the website without altering other sections. I learned how to troubleshoot problems. My practice with these programming languages prepares me to collaborate with SMEs such as programmers. Making the portfolio website allowed me the opportunity to see how different technologies enable the communication process.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 3</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to create effective and user&#8211;centered technical documentation justified with relevant theory.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 1, Artifact 2, and Artifact 6 demonstrate how I created effective user&#8211;centered technical documentation. Artifact 1, The Technical Report, meets the criteria for user&#8211;centered documentation because it was created with the user in mind every step of the way. In Dr. Grace&#8217;s English 5388 User Experience Research course, I have learned the importance of understanding the user&#8217;s needs. I explored this in the report by focusing the recommendations on how the current user&#8217;s needs were being met and how those needs could be met along a measurable timeline in the future. I based the recommendations of the usability report on how the users interacted with a designed system.</p>
      <p lang="en">Users interact with designed systems by forming mental models in their head about that system to understand the system&#8217;s design principles &#40;Crilly, 2011&#41;. When writing the report, I stepped into the mind of the user by investigating where the navigation became too complicated, or where the design features hindered language accessibility.</p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 2, the Risk Message, represents user&#8211;centered documentation because the risk message is a worksheet&#8212;an instructional artifact designed for the user to interact with and explore. A written simulation exercise was employed to teach the audience about the potential consequences surrounding the risk of texting while driving. The document was designed with the user in mind by including the exercise in the form of text questions, providing supplementary information at the end, and providing discussion questions that would further engage the user with the material. Due to the page limit of the assignment, I was constrained in the risk message I wanted to create.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 4</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to demonstrate sensitivity to the ethical, professional, and cultural issues that face technical communicators.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 4 and Artifact 3 best meet the program outcome of demonstrating sensitivity to ethical issues facing technical communicators. Editing is a vital part of a technical communicator&#8217;s work. Artifact 4, the Editing Values Statement, explores my ethical stances on issues facing the editing and digital publications field. I advocate for publishing spaces that are based in diversity, for using open access to make research more accessible, and to reexamine digital communication practices to include non&#8211;traditional forms of research. The artifact also addresses the professional issues facing technical editors by providing a standard for professionalism that can be communicated and upheld in the workplace when uncertain situations arise.</p>
      <p lang="en">Beck et al., &#40;1993&#41; provide a framework for understanding how ethics impacts technical writing as a profession. The authors state how technical communicators must be responsible for, &#8220;their communication choices,&#8221; where those choices reveal the ethics of the communicator. In a similar fashion, the Editing Values Statement allows me to take responsibility for my communication choices by providing a format where I clarify my ethical stances on various issues that technical communicators face. The artifact allows me to state my ethical beliefs, and then explain those beliefs in a sensitive manner.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 5</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to demonstrate the capacity to enter the workforce in technical communication as advanced hires, OR to enter doctoral programs in rhetoric, technical communication, and related fields.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">Artifact 5, Artifact 2, and Artifact 1 demonstrate my capacity to enter the workforce in technical communication as an advanced hire. Artifact 5 demonstrates how I have met this objective because I have written an effective example of a grant, an important workplace genre. I approached the grant&#8211;writing process in a similar manner to a hired professional&#58; I found an RFP, wrote a letter of intent to a potential funder, and constructed the grant according to the specifications found in the RFP.</p>
      <p lang="en">I collaborated with members of different communities to write the grant. I collaborated with Dr. Albrecht, a member of the academic community. Although I did not directly collaborate with other groups, my writing allowed me to practice collaborative skills. The grant project promoted collaboration with others. My letter of intent was addressed to the head of the ACFE Research Institute. The proposed project would partner Utah State University with the Shingo Institute to find clients, and with Qualtrics to produce surveys.</p>
      <p lang="en">The act of collaboration helps to form a sense of identity. There is a disparity between collaboration between academia and the workplace in technical writing. Increased collaboration across communities can help strengthen professional identity into <em>professional consciousness,</em> which is an identity anchored to a specific group over time &#40;Kline and Barker, 2012&#41;. The formation of a professional identity is a goal of the portfolio. But in addition, having a professional identity indicates readiness to enter the workplace, since I have had the opportunity to create my professional identity through my education and collaboration with others.</p>
      <h3>Outcome 6</h3>
      <p lang="en"><em>Students will be able to demonstrate a sense of professionalism and a commitment to the profession.</em></p>
      <p lang="en">The collection of my artifacts demonstrates my sense of professionalism and commitment to the profession. But one artifact that I feel represents this the most is Artifact 4, the Editing Values Statement. The artifact demonstrates my professionalism because I state my beliefs on problems facing the field in an open and respectful manner. Professionalism is defined by the ability to communicate beliefs and boundaries in an open and healthy manner. When problems are encountered, I can reference my own stances to others if needed, or use my beliefs as a self&#8211;reminder.</p>
      <p lang="en">The Editing Values Statement also demonstrates my commitment to the profession because the document reflects how I care about ethics in the workplace. By attaching my beliefs to specific issues, my beliefs turn into stances and demonstrate how I am committed to weaving ethical attitudes and behaviors into the workplace. The artifact also demonstrates my commitment to diversity and inclusivity, which are key principles for a successful and safe work environment.</p>
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p lang="en">The artifacts presented in the portfolio and analyzed in the reflective essay are a reflection of my growth as a technical communicator. My writing projects in their current state cannot be perfectly inserted into a workplace environment without some changes. But the principles and strategies that I learned from creating the artifacts are applicable in the workplace and demonstrate my readiness to become a professional.</p>
      <p lang="en">The principles that I have learned from creating my artifacts include&#58; study the target audience, use rhetorical strategies to improve how information is shared, clear communication involves multiple parties who need to find common ways of understanding, and effective writing is often impacted by the real&#8211;world contexts that surround practices, environments, and people. I am now able to carry these principles as I embark on my career as a technical communicator.</p>
